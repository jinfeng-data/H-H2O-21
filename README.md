# Calculation of the anharmonic IR spectra of H+(H2O)21

This project presents the calculated anharmonic IR spectra of the magic number H+(H2O)21
cluster using EE-GMF and VQDPT2 methods.

The EE-GMF code is in the "frag_code" directory. The guide for running EE-GMF is summarized
in the README file in the same directory.

The input and output files for the anharmonic IR spectra calculation by the VQDPT2 method 
are shown in the "input" and "output" directory.
