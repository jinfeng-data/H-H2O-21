# Calculation of the anharmonic IR spectra of H+(H2O)21

This project presents the calculated anharmonic IR spectra of the magic number H+(H2O)21
cluster by using EE-GMF and VQDPT2 methods.

The EE-GMF codes for the energy and force calculations (but without hessian) are in the 
"EE-GMF" directory. The EE-GMF codes for the hessian calculations are in the "EE-GMF_hessian" 
directory. The guide for running EE-GMF calculation is summarized in the README file in the 
corresponding same directory.

The input and output files for the anharmonic IR spectra calculation by the VQDPT2 method 
are shown in the "IR_input" and "IR_output" directory.
